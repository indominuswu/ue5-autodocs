# Packed Attributes Plugin Overview

## 1. What this plugin does

- Experimental animation plugin intended to explore packed attribute storage/processing.
- Current source contains only module stubs; no runtime API is exposed yet.
- Includes a test suite module for uncooked/editor use.

## 2. Key Modules

- **PackedAttributes** (Runtime)  
  - Role: Placeholder runtime module (no public API yet).
- **PackedAttributesTestSuite** (UncookedOnly)  
  - Role: Test harness for development validation.

## 3. Important Types & APIs

- No public headers are present; only module bootstrap files exist at this stage.

## 4. Typical usage patterns

- Intended for internal experimentation; there are no gameplay/editor workflows available in this state.
- Keep disabled in projects unless contributing to development or tests.

## 5. Version-specific notes (UE 5.7)

- Marked experimental with no surfaced APIs in UE 5.7; expect future revisions to add functionality.
