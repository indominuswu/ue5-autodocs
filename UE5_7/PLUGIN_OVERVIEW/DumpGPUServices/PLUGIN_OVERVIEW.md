# Dump GPU Services Plugin Overview

## 1. What this plugin does

- Implements upload services for GPU dumps generated by the `DumpGPU` command.
- Automatically uploads dump output (optionally compressed) to an HTTP endpoint and can launch a browser to the uploaded location.
- Experimental and enabled by default for non-server, non-shipping builds.

## 2. Key Modules

- **DumpGPUServices** (Runtime, Default; not for Server/Shipping)  
  - Role: Provides `IDumpGPUUploadServiceProvider` implementations, HTTP upload pipeline, and module registration.  
  - Notable types: `IDumpGPUServices`, `FDumpGPUServicesModule`, `FDumpGPUHTTPUploadProvider`, `FDumpGPUHTTPUpload`.

## 3. Important Types & APIs

### `IDumpGPUUploadServiceProvider`

- Role: Interface for upload providers used by DumpGPU; `FDumpGPUHTTPUploadProvider` implements it for HTTP targets.
- Key data: `FDumpParameters` (local path, type/time metadata, compression options, service parameters file).

### `FDumpGPUHTTPUploadProvider` / `FDumpGPUHTTPUpload`

- Role: Handles upload of dump files to an HTTP endpoint derived from a URL pattern.  
- Behavior: Recursively finds files, optionally compresses with `FCompression`, streams via `IHttpRequest` (overlapped uploads), reports progress (editor notifications), deletes local dump on success, opens URL on desktop platforms.

### `FDumpGPUServicesModule`

- Role: Registers the HTTP provider factory and ties into DumpGPU service discovery.

## 4. Typical usage patterns

- Run `DumpGPU` with upload enabled; the plugin will create an HTTP upload provider using the configured URL pattern and start uploading results.  
- Monitor progress via editor notifications (when available); on completion, the plugin can open the uploaded location in a browser.

## 5. Version-specific notes (UE 5.7)

- Marked experimental in 5.7; restricted from Server and Shipping targets. No additional 5.7-specific changes called out.
